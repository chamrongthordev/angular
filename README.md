# Angular Architecture

The architecture of Angular are building by these block. There are :
- Modules: a building block that's contain routes, components, services and more.
- Components: contains a template, data and logic, forming part of a DOM tree.
- Directives: attach behaviour, extend, or transform a particular element and its children.
- Services: data layer, logic that is not component related, such as API requests.
- Routing: renders a component based on the URL state, drives navigation.
